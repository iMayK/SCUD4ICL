A framework for semantic parsing that leverages decomposition to improve in-context learning accuracy. *SCUD4ICL*:

- Breaks down ASTs into meaningful, reusable fragments
- Employs LLM prompting to generate diverse training examples
- Uses structured example selection for semantic parsing tasks

Our approach shows significant improvements across benchmarks, with clear benefits for smaller models and low-resource languages.

Code will be released shortly!
